# CleanBot
Making and Tinkering Project Codebase

This project is still a work-in-progress.

Aim of this project is to create an autonomous cleaning robot that can navigate based on the below sensors:
1. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
2. MPU-6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer
3. CJMCU-3901 Optical Flow Sensor (Based off PMW-3901)
4. Limit Switches

Processing units used:
1. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB)
2. 2 * Arduino Mega 2560
3. Arduino UNO
The Arduinos are connected to the RPI through USB, data transfer through serial communication
